# Shows app

## Description
This is an Android app, written in Kotlin, which displays TV shows and movies. At first, you will be welcomed by the Login screen, after which you will be able to look at reviews from many other people and decide whether to watch a certain TV show or movie. Also, you are welcome to leave a review yourself and share your opinions with the world! More updates to come!
